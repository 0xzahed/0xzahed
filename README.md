## 🛡️ My Ethical Hacking Journey

👨‍🎓 **Background**:  
Currently pursuing BSc in Computer Science & Engineering (Final Year). Started my hacking journey to understand the real-world threats and defend systems better.

💡 **Why Hacking?**  
Because breaking things teaches you how to build them stronger. I believe ethical hacking is not just about testing — it's about securing the future.

🧪 **Focus Areas**:
- Web Application Vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF)
- Bug Bounty Hunting
- Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges
- OSINT & Recon
- Red Team Basics

🛠️ **Tools I Use**:
- Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark, Nikto, Dirb
- Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Ubuntu
- Python for scripting, JavaScript for XSS
- VS Code, Git, Postman

📚 **Currently Learning**:
- Advanced XSS & Bypass Techniques
- Bugcrowd/NahamSec methodologies
- CVE Analysis
- Linux Privilege Escalation

🔐 **Ultimate Goal**:
Become a professional penetration tester and contribute to global cybersecurity by responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities and educating others.
